# Puck Powerups
Adds powerups. Completely server-side, so clients don't need to install anything. Overrides the first 2 quick chats options ("I got it!" and "Need stamina"). Use 1-1 to activate your powerup, and 1-2 to check what your powerup is or to see its cooldown.

<b>Magnet</b>: Puck is magnetized towards your stick if it's close enough<br/>
<b>Lasso</b>: Pulls puck towards you quickly<br/>
<b>Rage</b>: Knocks down anyone you touch for 7 seconds<br/>
<b>Grapple</b>: Launches you towards the puck<br/>
<b>Punch</b>: Pushes the puck forward<br/>
<b>Glue</b>: Puck attaches to your stick for 2 seconds<br/>
<b>Kick</b>: Knocks over the nearest player on the other team<br/>
<b>Double tap 1 to use your ability</b><br/>

## Installation 
Download and unzip the latest [release](https://github.com/wenright/Puck_Powerups/releases) into your Puck/Plugins folder

You may also want to install the [motd](https://github.com/NAsejevs/GAFURIXCustomMOTD) mod and add instructions on how to activate powerups so new players don't have to ask each time. You can copy my sample motd [here](https://github.com/wenright/Puck_Powerups/blob/main/motd.txt).
